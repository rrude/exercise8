Hey Jude don't make it bad, 
Take a sad song and make it better, 
Remember, to let her into your heart, 
Then you can start to make it better. 

Hey Jude don't be afraid, 
You were made to go out and get her, 
The minute you let her under your skin, 
Then you begin to make it better. 

And anytime you feel the pain, 
Hey Jude refrain, 
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders. 

For well you know that it's a fool, 
Who plays it cool, 
By making his world a little colder. 

Hey Jude don't let me down, 
You have found her now go and get her, 
Remember (Hey Jude) to let her into your heart, 
Then you can start to make it better. 

So let it out and let it in 
Hey Jude begin, 
You're waiting for someone to perform with. 

And don't you know that it's just you. 
Hey Jude, you'll do, 
The movement you need is on your shoulder. 

Hey Jude, don't make it bad, 
Take a sad song and make it better, 
Remember to let her under your skin, 
Then you'll begin to make it all better, better, better, better, 
better, better, better, ah! 
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na. 
Hey Jude, Jude , Jude, Jude, Jude, yeah, yeah! 

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup, 
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe. 
Pools of sorrow waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind, 
Possessing and caressing me.

Nothing's gonna change my world 
Nothing's gonna change my world. 
Nothing's gonna change my world 
Nothing's gonna change my world. 

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes, 
They call me on and on across the universe, 
Thoughts meander like a restless wind 
Inside a letter box they 
Tumble blindly as they make their way 
Across the universe 

Jai guru deva om 
Nothing's gonna change my world 
Nothing's gonna change my world. 
Nothing's gonna change my world 
Nothing's gonna change my world. 

Sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing 
Through my open ears inciting and inviting me. 
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns, 
And calls me on and on across the universe

Nothing's gonna change my world 
Nothing's gonna change my world. 
Nothing's gonna change my world

Spending someone's
Hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving
Not arriving
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home

Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing so low
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be

The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before it always leads me here
Leads me to your door

The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know the many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here, lead me to you door

But still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here, lead me to you door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah    

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around now it may show
I don't know, I don't know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

Don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how


My baby says she's trav'ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909

I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
You're only fooling around, you're fooling around with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909

I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says you've got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

Well I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun

Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun

Picture yourself in a boat on a river, 
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies 
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly, 
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes. 

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green, 
Towering over your head. 
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes, 
And she's gone. 

Lucy in the sky with diamonds 
Lucy in the sky with diamonds 
Lucy in the sky with diamonds 
Ahh... 

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain 
Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies, 
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers, 
That grow so incredibly high. 

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore, 
Waiting to take you away. 
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds, 
And you're gone. 

Lucy in the sky with diamonds 
Lucy in the sky with diamonds 
Lucy in the sky with diamonds 
Ahh... 

Picture yourself on a train in a station, 
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties, 
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle, 
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes. 

Lucy in the sky with diamonds 
Lucy in the sky with diamonds 
Lucy in the sky with diamonds 

Try to see it my way,
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on? 
While you see it your way,
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone.
We can work it out,
We can work it out.
Think of what you're saying.
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright.
Think of what I'm saying,
We can work it out and get it straight, or say good night.
We can work it out,
We can work it out.
Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend.
I have always thought that it's a crime,
So I will ask you once again.
Try to see it my way,
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong.
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long.

Won't you please, please help me.

Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Why she had to go I don't know she woldn't say.

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Won't you please, please help me, help me, help me, oh


Try to see it my way,
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on? 
While you see it your way,
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone.
We can work it out,
We can work it out.
Think of what you're saying.
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright.
Think of what I'm saying,
We can work it out and get it straight, or say good night.
We can work it out,
We can work it out.
Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend.
I have always thought that it's a crime,
So I will ask you once again.
Try to see it my way,
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong.
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long.
We can work it out,
We can work it out.
Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend.
I have always thought that it's a crime,
So I will ask you once again.
Try to see it my way,
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong.
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long.
We can work it out,
We can work it out.

n the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all on board
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

As we live a life of ease
Everyone of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine.

We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for? 

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ? 
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong ? 

Father mckenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near.
Look at him working. darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care? 

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from? 
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong? 

Eleanor rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father mckenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from? 
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?


In penny lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In penny lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
It's a clean machine.

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho' she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway.

In penny lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies,
Penny lane.


You say yes, I say no.
You say stop and I say go go go, oh no.
You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello.

I say high, you say low.
You say why and I say I don't know, oh no.
You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello goodbye hello goodbye hello hello
Hello goodbye I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello goodbye hello goodbye hello hello
Hello goodbye I don't know why you say goodbye
Hello goodbye I say goodbye.

Why why why why why why do you say goodbye goodbye, oh no? 

You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello.

You say yes I say yes I say no but I may mean no.
You say stop I can stay and I say go go go till it's time to go oh, oh no.
You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say goodbye
Hello hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello hello.

Hela heba helloa cha cha, hela...



Lady madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.
Who finds the money? when you pay the rent? 
Did you think that money was heaven sent? 

Friday night arrives without a suitcase.
Sunday morning creep in like a nun.
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace.
See how they run.

Lady madonna, baby at your breast.
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest.

See how they run.
Lady madonna, lying on the bed,
Listen to the music playing in your head.

Tuesday afternoon is never ending.
Wednesday morning papers didn't come.
Thursday night you stockings needed mending.
See how they run.

Lady madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner

For some california grass.

Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back jojo. go home
Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged

Back to where you once belonged.
Get back jo.

Sweet loretta martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back loretta. go home
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back loretta
Your mother's waiting for you
Wearing her high-heel shoes
And her low-neck sweater
Get on home loretta
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.


Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France.
The man in the mac said you’ve got to go back,
You know they didn’t even give us a chance.
Christ! You know it ain’t easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going,
They’re going to crucify me.
Finally made the plane into Paris,
Honeymooning down by the Seine.
Peter Brown called to say,
You can make it OK,
You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain.
Christ! You know it ain’t easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going,
They’re going to crucify me.
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton,
Talking in our beds for a week.
The newspapers said, say what’re you doing in bed,
I said we’re only trying to get us some peace.
Christ! You know it ain’t easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going,
They’re going to crucify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day,
Giving all your clothes to charity.
Last night the wife said,
Oh boy, when you’re dead you don’t take nothing with you but your soul –
Think!
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,
Eating choc’late cake in a bag.
The newspapers said,
She’s gone to his head,
They look just like two Gurus in a drag.
Christ! You know it ain’t easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going,
They’re going to crucify me.
Caught the early plane back to London,
Fifty acorns tied in a sack.
The men from the press said we wish you success,
It’s good to have the both of you back.
Christ! You know it ain’t easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going,
They’re going to crucify me.

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Don't want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around now it may show
I don't know, I don't know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

Don't want to leave her now
You know I believe her now


Here come old flattop he come grooving up slowly
He got joo-joo eyeball he one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
Got to be a joker he just do what he please

He wear no shoeshine he got toe-jam football
He got monkey finger he shoot coca-cola
He say I know you, you know me
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
Come together right now over me

He bag production he got walrus gumboot
He got ono sideboard he one spinal cracker
He got feet down below his knee
Hold you in his armchair you can feel his disease
Come together right now over me

He roller-coaster he got early warning
He got muddy water he one mojo filter
He say one and one and one is three
Got to be good-looking 'cause he's so hard to see
Come together right now over me

The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear, I’ve seen that road before
It always leads me here, leads me to your door.
The wild and windy night that the rain washed away,
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way.
Many times I’ve been alone and many times I’ve cried,
Anyway you’ll never know the many ways I’ve tried, but
Still they lead me back to the long and winding road,
You left me standing here a long, long time ago.
Don’t leave me waiting here, lead me to your door.
Da da, da da





Don’t go for what you know you can get. Go for what you really want 
Responsibility can never be given. It can only be taken 

If we think of defeat, that is what we will get. If we are undecided, nothing will happen to us. We must just pick something great to do and do it. Never do we think of failure at all, for as we think now, that is what we will get 

No action can be performed successfully without a clear result in view.

The secret of success is conviction and persistence.

What makes one luckier is the good that he has done to others. It comes back to him. A man doesn’t become lucky by doing wrong. He becomes lucky because he has done good to others and that good comes back to him. And now he is lucky.

It is the purity of man’s heart and mind, and his innocent and faithful approach to action with the purpose of all good to everyone, which really succeeds in yielding maximum results with minimum effort. 

You are the master of all the laws of nature if you know the transcendental field.

The golden gate to peace in life is the experience of bliss, and it is easy for everyone to acquire this great glory and live it throughout life.

By enlivening this most basic level of life, Transcendental Meditation is that one simple procedure which can raise the life of every individual and every society to its full dignity, in which problems are absent and perfect health, happiness, and a rapid pace of progress are the natural features of life.

A comfortable and regulated life is needed for fastest pace of evolution.

Naturalness is the basis of effectiveness.

Transcendental Meditation opens the awareness to the infinite reservoir of energy, creativity, and intelligence that lies deep within everyone. 

In the field of knowledge is all possibility.

Fulfilment is structured in achievement, Achievement is structured in action, Action is structured in thinking, Thinking is structured in knowledge, Knowledge is structured in consciousness.

Life is all business. Spend your energy to get joy, happiness, evolution, and to gain more ability to enjoy. In this field we spend our energy. We never use our time, energy, speech, or ability to do something that doesn’t help us grow and improve our life. It’s not worth it.

Whatever we put our attention on, will grow stronger in our life.

Life finds its purpose and fulfillment in the expansion of happiness.

The important thing is this: to be able, at any moment, to sacrifice what we are for what we could become.

We must take situations as they are. We must only change our mental attitudes towards them.

Success in anything is through happiness.

Keep your desire turning back within and be patient.
Allow the fulfilment to come to you.
Gently resist the temptation to chase your dreams into the world;
pursue them in your heart until they disappear into the Self, and leave them there.
It may take a little self-discipline, be simple, be kind, stay rested.
Attend to your own inner-health and happiness.
Happiness radiates like the fragrance from a flower and draws all good things towards you.
Allow your love to nourish yourself as well as others.
Do not strain after your needs of life - it is sufficient to be quietly alert and aware of them.
In this way life proceeds more naturally, effortlessly.
Life is here to enjoy.
Decide what you want and don't think of the intermediary conditions. When Nature works for us we should want what we want and Nature will work it out for us.

If we think of defeat, that's what we'll get. If we are undecided then nothing will happen for us. 
We must just pick something GREAT to do, and then DO it. 
Never think of failure at all, for as we think now, that's what we'll get.

There is nothing in the cosmos, either in the material plane or the spiritual plane which cannot be directly cognized.

Competition is for the competent.

When the elephant decides to walk through the village, all the dogs come out and bark.


Doubts are the dry rot of life. Doubts are death.
Enjoy your life and be happy. 
Being happy is of the utmost importance. 
Success in anything is through happiness. 
More support of nature comes from being happy. 
Under all circumstances be happy, even if you have to force it a bit to change some long standing habits. 
Just think of any negativity that comes to you as a raindrop falling into the ocean of your bliss. 
You may not always have an ocean of bliss, but think that way anyway and it will help it come. 
Doubting is not blissful and does not create happiness. 
Be happy, healthy, and let all that love flow through your heart.
It is the focus on the highest ideal day after day that saves life from being wrapped up in small whirlwinds.

All freedom to man, but freedom is useful when we know what life is, when we know what past is, what present is, when we know how to go about things, not that every man should be left to experiment by himself.
Well, you see, it is like this. Absolutely everything is fixed, and absolutely everything can be changed at any time.

Decide what you want and don't think of intermediary conditions. 
When Nature works for us, we should want what we want and Nature will work it out for us.
In Thy fullness, my Lord, 
Filled with thy grace, 
For the purpose of union with Thee 
And to satisfy and glorify Thy creation, 
With thanks to Thee with all our hearts 
And with all our love for Thee, 
With all adoration for all Thy blessings 
We accept thy gift as it has come to us. 
The food is Thy blessing and in Thy service 
We accept in all gratitude, my Lord.

Naturalness is the basis of effectiveness.
We have an infinite number of reasons to be happy, and a serious responsibility not be serious.

About humility we speak with an analogy: When the branches are full of fruit, they just bow down.

What we have been saying from the beginning of the Movement has been unbelievable but it has come to be believed. We have been impossible right from the beginning and we must continue to be impossible because we are raising a voice against suffering which has been considered to be the nature of life. It is our joy to be considered impossible - and it is our greater joy to make the impossible a living reality.

If you want to pay off your debts, it pays to increase your earning power.
Life is bliss.

Man is born to enjoy.
Human nervous system is the greatest gift of the creator.

Love opens all doors, no matter how closed they may be, no matter how rusty from lack of use. Your work is to bring unity and harmony, to open all doors which have been closed for a long time. Have patience and tolerance. Open your heart all the time.

Personal love is concentrated universal love.
Love in the heart of man is a shrine to God on Earth.
If a man is able to submit himself to nature, then nature will react to his needs. Almighty nature is all powerful and all loving, for the laws of nature are for the creation and evolution of all beings and creatures throughout the cosmos. There is no greater kindness than the kindness of nature.

Do not base your life on the likings and dislikings or whims of others. What you are in life - whether you enjoy or suffer - it is your own responsibility. Be regular in your meditation and do not postpone for a later date your striving for God consciousness.

Do not oppose because in opposing the tenderness of the feeling level is crushed. 
All action should be to nourish the fine feeling developed in the practice of the TM sidhi program. 
That is why we say Speak the Truth but see that you are speaking delicately. 
Do not speak non-truth and do not speak in a non sweet way, so that the feeling is nourished. 
The whole effect of activity is to enrich the feeling of the other. 
Be as delicate as possible. 
If communication accomplishes something on the gross but damages something on the level of feeling then it is a spiritual loss! 
The feeling is more important for life. 
Nourishment of the feeling level is the basis for growth of the spiritual holistic value. 
Delicate behaviour on the surface should be such as to nourish, uphold and enhance the Transcendental value where feelings merge into a common source. 
Do not oppose. 
Opposition is dangerous to immortality.

Nature knows best how to organise.

Know what you want, decide when you want it, figure your plan of action, follow through on it, and never doubt.

Unless an action is rightly thought out and its steps rightly planned, every stage of its performance will probably remain vague and therefore unsatisfactory for the doer and all those concerned.

Problems are all in your head.

All problems in life arise from some weakness of mind. All weakness of mind is due to the mind's ignorance of its own essential nature, which is universal and the source of infinite energy and intelligence. ... In order to root out any problem of life it is only necessary to be brought out of ignorance, to be brought to knowledge.

Problems are not solved on the level of problems. Analysing a problem to find its solution is like trying to restore freshness to a leaf by treating the leaf itself, whereas the solution lies in watering the root.

We are born only to bless, not to punish. 
This you should never forget. 
We should always see good things in others - very important. 
We are not in a position to criticize anyone. 
The existence of enemies means for us that our friendliness has not been sufficient enough. 
'God helps those who help themselves.' - it's a very true saying. 
We are aware of darkness but for our own community we want to have Enlightenment.

The purpose of life is the expansion of happiness.

The formula for producing maximum results is to disregard the obstacles and negative influences which offer resistance to the performance of action. The doer should engage in action and continue until the desired results are achieved. When the standard of consciousness is raised through the process of meditation, the action performed at that higher level of life energy and intelligence will have an overriding influence on karma from the past and will produce maximum results. 
This is how, by the regular practice of Transcendental Meditation supplemented by the power of charity and virtuous deeds, the negative influence of past karma can be counteracted and the path of present karma smoothed. Then the action will be performed without resistance or obstacle, yielding maximum results. 
This is how, by the power of present action or karma, destiny is controlled. Herein lies the full meaning of the saying that man is a master of his own destiny.


Silence vibrating is Creation. Silence flowing is Love. Silence shared is Friendship. Silence seen is Infinity. Silence heard is Adoration. Silence expressed is Beauty. Silence maintained is Strength. Silence omitted is Suffering. Silence allowed is Rest. Silence recorded is Scripture. Silence preserved is Our Tradition. Silence given is Initiating. Silence received is Joy. Silence perceived is Knowledge. Silence stabilized is Fulfillment. Silence alone is.

Sleep in the bliss of God. 
Feel love of God, Lie in the showers of his blessings. 
Let your heart melt in the love of God. 
Sleep in the love of God and in Love. 
Sleep in the warmth of Divine Grace, 
Without my words -- only in this feeling

There is nothing that can be said so certainly about stress except that the amount of rest produced will neutralise the corresponding intensity of stress.

The secret of success in business is creativity. The urgent need in business today is to develop the field of creativity that lies deep within each individual. Through Transcendental Meditation the awareness of the individual comes into contact with this field of unlimited creativity, pure consciousness, the Constitution of the Universe.

The factor of time is very vital in life. Those who have accomplished great things in the world have been those who valued time in their life. The time of life is limited and a great amount of evolution has to be accomplished for fulfilment of life. Therefore, the factor of time must be valued above everything.

A good teacher will appreciate the good qualities of his students. If one good quality is allowed to emerge, a world of good qualities will emerge from that one.

This is the whole aim of the Vedas: that no man engaged in the field of diversity--field of diversity means field of death, field of change--no man engaged in the field of change should ever be allowed to remain there all the time. He should be given the opportunity, his body and mind should be cultured so that imperishable state of eternal Being permeates all these changing phenomena in the relative world.

God grants us the faculty to open ourselves to peace. If we don't then we are responsible if wars continue.


If we are all strong, stable, we can set our sail with any wind in the world that comes along. We make up our own direction. If we are not strong, we are like a leaf in the wind and the world's winds will take us where THEY wish, not where WE wish. So we meditate, EVERY DAY, REGULARLY, and gain transcendental being in our everyday life and then we are strong. When we are all infused with Being, we need not think which course is right, we just take the one that is automatically. Being is the wind-resister and the sail-setter...

It is the responsibility of the older generation to advise the young, to tell the child what is right and wrong. Even if they do not want to listen to follow our direction, it is right to tell them.

In Thy presence, my Lord, filled with Thy grace, 
and for the purpose of union with Thee 
I am starting Yoga Asanas. 
Grant me good health, energy, and efficiency in life. 
I feel Thy grace, Thy divine presence.
