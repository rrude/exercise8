Hey Jude don't make it bad, 
Take a sad song and make it better, 
Remember, to let her into your heart, 
Then you can start to make it better. 

Hey Jude don't be afraid, 
You were made to go out and get her, 
The minute you let her under your skin, 
Then you begin to make it better. 

And anytime you feel the pain, 
Hey Jude refrain, 
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders. 

For well you know that it's a fool, 
Who plays it cool, 
By making his world a little colder. 

Hey Jude don't let me down, 
You have found her now go and get her, 
Remember (Hey Jude) to let her into your heart, 
Then you can start to make it better. 

So let it out and let it in 
Hey Jude begin, 
You're waiting for someone to perform with. 

And don't you know that it's just you. 
Hey Jude, you'll do, 
The movement you need is on your shoulder. 

Hey Jude, don't make it bad, 
Take a sad song and make it better, 
Remember to let her under your skin, 
Then you'll begin to make it all better, better, better, better, 
better, better, better, ah! 
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na. 
Hey Jude, Jude , Jude, Jude, Jude, yeah, yeah! 

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup, 
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe. 
Pools of sorrow waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind, 
Possessing and caressing me. 

Jai guru deva om 
Nothing's gonna change my world 
Nothing's gonna change my world. 
Nothing's gonna change my world 
Nothing's gonna change my world. 

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes, 
They call me on and on across the universe, 
Thoughts meander like a restless wind 
Inside a letter box they 
Tumble blindly as they make their way 
Across the universe 

Jai guru deva om 
Nothing's gonna change my world 
Nothing's gonna change my world. 
Nothing's gonna change my world 
Nothing's gonna change my world. 

Sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing 
Through my open ears inciting and inviting me. 
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns, 
And calls me on and on across the universe 

Jai guru deva om 
Nothing's gonna change my world 
Nothing's gonna change my world. 
Nothing's gonna change my world 
Nothing's gonna change my world.

It's been a hard day's night, 
And I've been working like a dog, 
It's been a hard day's night, 
I should be sleeping like a log, 
But when I get home to you, 
I find the things that you do, 
Will make me feel alright. 

You know I work all day, 
To get you money to buy you things, 
And it's worth it just to hear you say, 
You're gonna give me everything, 
So why on earth should I moan, 
Cause when I get you alone, 
You know I feel okay. 

When I'm home everything seems to be right, 
When I'm home feeling you holding me 
Tight, tight, yeah. 

It's been a hard day's night,

Will make me feel alright.
